# Requirements: User Knowledge Management System

## Overview

Enable users to build and maintain a personal knowledge base within kse projects, allowing them to capture experiences, patterns, and best practices. The system should intelligently evaluate knowledge value and suggest integration into project documentation or core principles.

## User Stories

**As a** kse user  
**I want to** initialize a knowledge base in my project  
**So that** I can start capturing my experiences and learnings

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- Command `kse knowledge init` creates `.kiro/knowledge/` directory structure
- Creates README.md with usage guide

- Creates backup before deletion
- Updates index.json
- Shows deletion summary

### US-8: AI Knowledge Analysis
**As a** kse user

**So that** I can understand its value and get improvement suggestions

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- Command `kse knowledge analyze` evaluates all entries
- Analyzes: universality, project-specificity, temporality, documentation value
- Scores each entry (0-100)
- Suggests actions: integrate to CORE_PRINCIPLES, move to docs, keep in knowledge/, archive
- Detects duplicate or overlapping content
- Generates analysis report

### US-9: Knowledge Integration
**As a** kse user

### US-12: Knowledge Statistics
**As a** kse user  
**I want to** see statistics about my knowledge base  
**So that** I can track my learning progress

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- Command `kse knowledge stats` shows statistics
- Shows: total entries, entries by type, entries by tag
- Shows: creation timeline, most referenced entries
- Shows: integration history
- Visualizes trends (text-based charts)

## Non-Functional Requirements

### NFR-1: Performance
- List command should complete in <100ms for 1000 entries
- Search should complete in <200ms for 1000 entries
- Analysis should complete in <5s for 100 entries

### NFR-2: Storage
- Knowledge base should not exceed 50MB by default
- Warn user when approaching limit
- Support cleanup of old/unused entries

### NFR-3: Token Efficiency
- Knowledge base should NOT be auto-loaded into AI context
- Only load when explicitly queried
- Keep index.json minimal (<100KB)

### NFR-4: Compatibility
- Work on Windows, Linux, macOS
- Support both cmd and PowerShell on Windows
- Handle special characters in titles and content

### NFR-5: Data Integrity
- Validate frontmatter on all operations

- Automatic backup before destructive operations

### NFR-6: Extensibility
- Support custom knowledge types via configuration
- Support custom templates for each type
- Support plugins for custom analyzers

## Technical Requirements

├── README.md              # Usage guide
├── index.json             # Metadata index

  "entries": [
    {
      "id": "kb-001",
      "type": "pattern",
      "title": "Repository Pattern Best Practices",
      "file": "patterns/repository-pattern-best-practices.md",

    "totalEntries": 1,
    "byType": { "pattern": 1 },
    "byStatus": { "active": 1 }
  }
}
```

### TR-4: CLI Integration
- Add `knowledge` command to main CLI
- Use Commander.js for command structure
- Consistent error handling and output formatting
- Support `--help` for all commands

### TR-5: AI Integration
- Provide API for AI agents to query knowledge base
- Support semantic search (keyword-based initially, can enhance later)
- Return structured results for programmatic use

## Success Metrics

1. **Adoption**: 50% of kse users initialize knowledge base within first month
2. **Usage**: Average 5+ entries per active user
3. **Integration**: 20% of entries get integrated into project docs
4. **Satisfaction**: 4.5+ star rating from users
5. **Performance**: All commands meet NFR-1 performance targets

## Out of Scope (Future Enhancements)

- Vector-based semantic search
- Knowledge graph visualization
- Team collaboration features (shared knowledge base)
- Version control for individual entries
- AI-generated knowledge summaries
- Integration with external knowledge bases (Notion, Confluence)

## Dependencies

- Existing kse CLI infrastructure
- fs-extra for file operations
- Commander.js for CLI
- chalk for colored output
- Existing AI integration for analysis features

## Risks and Mitigations

| Risk | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|--------|------------|
| Users don't adopt feature | High | Clear documentation, examples, onboarding |
| Knowledge base grows too large | Medium | Size limits, cleanup tools, warnings |
| Analysis quality varies | Medium | Iterative improvement, user feedback |
| Integration conflicts | Low | Backup system, conflict resolution |

## Acceptance Criteria Summary

- All 12 user stories implemented and tested
- All NFRs met (performance, storage, token efficiency)
- Comprehensive documentation (user guide, examples)
- 90%+ test coverage
- Zero critical bugs
- Positive user feedback from beta testing
