# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This document specifies the requirements for a multi-repository management feature in KSE (Kiro Spec Engine). The feature enables developers to manage multiple Git subrepositories within a single project through a unified command-line interface. This addresses the common challenge of coordinating operations across multiple independent repositories that together form a complete project.

## Glossary

- **KSE**: Kiro Spec Engine - the CLI tool being enhanced
- **Multi_Repo_Manager**: The system component that manages multiple Git repositories
- **Project_Config**: The configuration file (project-repos.json) that defines all subrepositories
- **Subrepository**: An independent Git repository within the project directory
- **Health_Check**: A diagnostic operation that verifies repository configuration and connectivity
- **Batch_Operation**: An operation executed across multiple repositories simultaneously

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Configuration File Management

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to define and manage a configuration file for all my subrepositories, so that I can maintain a single source of truth for repository information.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. THE Multi_Repo_Manager SHALL store configuration in `.kiro/project-repos.json`
2. WHEN the configuration file is created, THE Multi_Repo_Manager SHALL include repository name, path, remote URL, and default branch for each subrepository
3. WHEN a repository path is specified, THE Multi_Repo_Manager SHALL validate that the path exists and contains a valid Git repository
4. WHEN a repository path is relative, THE Multi_Repo_Manager SHALL resolve it relative to the project root directory
5. THE Multi_Repo_Manager SHALL support both absolute and relative paths for repository locations
6. WHEN the configuration file is malformed, THE Multi_Repo_Manager SHALL return a descriptive error message indicating the specific validation failure

### Requirement 2: Repository Discovery and Initialization

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to automatically discover all Git repositories in my project, so that I can quickly generate the initial configuration without manual entry.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the init command is executed, THE Multi_Repo_Manager SHALL scan the project directory for Git repositories
2. WHEN a Git repository is found, THE Multi_Repo_Manager SHALL extract its remote URL and current branch
3. WHEN multiple remotes exist, THE Multi_Repo_Manager SHALL use the origin remote by default
4. WHEN no origin remote exists, THE Multi_Repo_Manager SHALL use the first available remote
5. WHEN a repository has no remotes, THE Multi_Repo_Manager SHALL include it in the configuration with a null remote URL
6. THE Multi_Repo_Manager SHALL exclude the `.kiro` directory from repository scanning
7. WHEN the configuration file already exists, THE Multi_Repo_Manager SHALL prompt for confirmation before overwriting
8. WHEN scanning completes, THE Multi_Repo_Manager SHALL display a summary of discovered repositories

### Requirement 3: Repository Status Reporting

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to view the Git status of all my subrepositories at once, so that I can quickly identify which repositories have uncommitted changes or are out of sync.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the status command is executed, THE Multi_Repo_Manager SHALL display the current branch for each repository
2. WHEN a repository has uncommitted changes, THE Multi_Repo_Manager SHALL indicate the number of modified, added, and deleted files

4. WHEN a repository has unpulled commits, THE Multi_Repo_Manager SHALL indicate the number of commits behind the remote
5. WHEN a repository is in a clean state, THE Multi_Repo_Manager SHALL display a clean status indicator
6. WHEN a repository path is invalid or inaccessible, THE Multi_Repo_Manager SHALL display an error status for that repository
7. THE Multi_Repo_Manager SHALL display status information in a tabular format for easy scanning
8. WHEN the verbose flag is provided, THE Multi_Repo_Manager SHALL include detailed file-level changes

### Requirement 4: Batch Command Execution

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to execute the same Git command across all my subrepositories, so that I can perform coordinated operations efficiently.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the exec command is executed with a Git command, THE Multi_Repo_Manager SHALL execute that command in each repository sequentially
2. WHEN a command succeeds in a repository, THE Multi_Repo_Manager SHALL display the command output for that repository
3. WHEN a command fails in a repository, THE Multi_Repo_Manager SHALL display the error message and continue with remaining repositories
4. THE Multi_Repo_Manager SHALL display a clear separator between outputs from different repositories
5. WHEN all commands complete, THE Multi_Repo_Manager SHALL display a summary showing success and failure counts
6. THE Multi_Repo_Manager SHALL support any valid Git command including arguments and flags
7. WHEN the dry-run flag is provided, THE Multi_Repo_Manager SHALL display the commands that would be executed without executing them
8. THE Multi_Repo_Manager SHALL preserve the exit code of failed commands in the summary

### Requirement 5: Health Check and Diagnostics

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to verify that all my subrepositories are properly configured and accessible, so that I can identify and fix configuration issues proactively.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the health command is executed, THE Multi_Repo_Manager SHALL verify that each repository path exists and is accessible
2. WHEN checking a repository, THE Multi_Repo_Manager SHALL verify that it is a valid Git repository
3. WHEN checking a repository, THE Multi_Repo_Manager SHALL verify that the configured remote URL is reachable
4. WHEN checking a repository, THE Multi_Repo_Manager SHALL verify that the configured default branch exists
5. WHEN a health check fails, THE Multi_Repo_Manager SHALL provide a specific error message indicating the failure reason
6. WHEN all health checks pass, THE Multi_Repo_Manager SHALL display a success message for each repository
7. THE Multi_Repo_Manager SHALL display health check results in a clear, color-coded format
8. WHEN the health command completes, THE Multi_Repo_Manager SHALL display an overall health summary

### Requirement 6: Configuration Validation

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the system to validate my configuration file, so that I can catch errors before attempting operations.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN loading the configuration, THE Multi_Repo_Manager SHALL verify that the file contains valid JSON
2. WHEN loading the configuration, THE Multi_Repo_Manager SHALL verify that required fields (name, path) are present for each repository
3. WHEN a repository name contains invalid characters, THE Multi_Repo_Manager SHALL reject the configuration
4. WHEN duplicate repository names exist, THE Multi_Repo_Manager SHALL reject the configuration
5. WHEN duplicate repository paths exist, THE Multi_Repo_Manager SHALL reject the configuration
6. THE Multi_Repo_Manager SHALL validate that repository paths do not overlap or nest within each other
