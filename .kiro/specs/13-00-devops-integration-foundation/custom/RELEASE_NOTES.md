## 🎉 What's New

### DevOps Integration Foundation

kse v1.8.0 introduces a complete DevOps integration foundation that enables AI to progressively manage operations across multiple environments. This release transforms kse from a development tool into a comprehensive DevOps platform.

---

## 🚀 Key Features

### 1. Operations Spec Management

**Standardized operations documentation** for capturing operational knowledge:

- **9 Document Types**:
  - `deployment.md` - Deployment procedures and rollback
  - `monitoring.md` - Metrics, thresholds, and alerts
  - `operations.md` - Daily operational tasks
  - `troubleshooting.md` - Common issues and resolutions
  - `rollback.md` - Rollback triggers and procedures
  - `change-impact.md` - Change classification and risk assessment
  - `migration-plan.md` - Migration strategies and validation
  - `feedback-response.md` - Feedback handling procedures
  - `tools.yaml` - AI-driven tool selection configuration

**Benefits**:
- Operations knowledge captured during development
- Version-specific operations management
- Human-readable markdown format
- Machine-processable structure

### 2. Progressive AI Autonomy (L1-L5 Takeover Levels)

**Five levels of AI autonomy** for gradual transition to AI-driven operations:

| Level | Name | Behavior |
|-------|------|----------|
| **L1** | Observation | AI observes and logs only |
| **L2** | Suggestion | AI suggests, human executes |
| **L3** | Semi-Auto | AI executes non-critical operations |
| **L4** | Auto | AI executes most operations |
| **L5** | Fully Autonomous | Full AI autonomy |

**Environment-Based Controls**:
- Development: L3-L5 allowed (high autonomy)
- Test: L2-L4 allowed (moderate autonomy)
- Pre-Production: L2-L3 max (controlled autonomy)
- Production: L1-L2 max (human oversight required)

**Benefits**:
- Safe, gradual transition to AI operations
- Environment-specific security controls
- Permission elevation mechanism
- Complete audit trail

### 3. Audit Logging System

**Tamper-evident audit trail** with comprehensive logging:

**Features**:
- SHA-256 hash-based integrity verification
- Complete operation logging (timestamp, type, parameters, outcome, level, environment)
- Query and filter capabilities
- Export to JSON, CSV, PDF
- Anomaly detection and flagging
- Daily audit summaries

**Benefits**:
- Compliance and regulatory requirements
- Incident investigation
- Performance analysis
- Security monitoring

### 4. Feedback Integration System

**Automated user feedback processing** and analytics:

**Capabilities**:
- Multiple feedback channels (support tickets, monitoring alerts, user reports, API endpoints, surveys)
- Automatic classification (bug report, performance issue, feature request, operational concern)
- Severity prioritization (critical, high, medium, low)
- Resolution lifecycle tracking (acknowledged → investigating → resolved → verified)
- Feedback analytics (common issues, resolution times, satisfaction trends, version-specific issues)
- Automated response support with takeover level controls

**Benefits**:
- Proactive issue detection
- Data-driven operational improvements
- Customer satisfaction tracking
- Version-specific issue analysis

### 5. Operations Validation

**Complete spec validation** with clear error reporting:

**Validation Checks**:
- Structure validation (all required documents present)
- Content validation (required sections in each document)
- Template compliance
- Clear error messages with specific missing elements

**Benefits**:
- Ensures operations spec completeness
- Prevents deployment of incomplete documentation
- Guides developers to create complete specs

```bash
# Get current takeover level
kse ops takeover get my-service

# Set takeover level
kse ops takeover set L3_SEMI_AUTO my-service --reason "Successful operation history"

```

### `kse ops feedback <action> [options]`

Manage user feedback.

```bash
# List all feedback
kse ops feedback list

# Filter by severity
kse ops feedback list --severity critical

# Filter by status
kse ops feedback list --status investigating
