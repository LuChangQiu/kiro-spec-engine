# Task 2 Verification Report

**Task**: Implement workspace registry CRUD operations  
**Status**: ✅ COMPLETE  
**Date**: 2026-01-28

## Summary

Task 2 and its sub-tasks (2.1, 2.4, 2.6) have been successfully implemented and verified. All 48 unit tests are passing, confirming the implementation meets the requirements.

## Sub-Tasks Completed

### ✅ 2.1 Implement workspace creation with validation

**Implementation**: `WorkspaceRegistry.createWorkspace(name, path)`

**Requirements Coverage**:
- ✅ **Req 1.1**: Creates workspace entry with name and path
- ✅ **Req 1.2**: Checks for duplicate names and throws error
- ✅ **Req 1.4**: Validates path contains `.kiro/` directory
- ✅ **Req 1.5**: Stores name, absolute path, creation timestamp, last accessed timestamp
- ✅ **Req 12.5**: Validates workspace paths exist and are accessible

**Validation Features**:
- Empty name validation
- Duplicate name checking
- Path existence validation
- Directory validation (not a file)
- `.kiro/` directory validation
- Clear, actionable error messages
- Automatic persistence to disk

**Tests Passing**:
- ✅ should reject empty workspace name
- ✅ should reject invalid workspace path
- ✅ should create workspace with valid path
- ✅ should reject duplicate workspace names
- ✅ should persist workspace to disk

### ✅ 2.4 Implement workspace listing and retrieval

**Implementation**: 
- `WorkspaceRegistry.getWorkspace(name)` - Retrieve by name
- `WorkspaceRegistry.listWorkspaces()` - List all workspaces
- `WorkspaceRegistry.hasWorkspace(name)` - Check existence
- `WorkspaceRegistry.findWorkspaceByPath(path)` - Find by path

**Requirements Coverage**:
- ✅ **Req 2.1**: Lists all registered workspaces
- ✅ **Req 6.4**: Supports sorting by last accessed timestamp (data available)

**Tests Passing**:
- ✅ should get workspace by name
- ✅ should return null for non-existent workspace
- ✅ should list all workspaces
- ✅ should check if workspace exists
- ✅ should find workspace by path

### ✅ 2.6 Implement workspace removal

**Implementation**: `WorkspaceRegistry.removeWorkspace(name)`

**Requirements Coverage**:
- ✅ **Req 4.1**: Removes workspace entry from registry
- ✅ **Req 4.4**: Does NOT delete files from workspace directory
- ⚠️ **Req 4.2**: Clearing active workspace handled at command level (Task 5.4)

**Tests Passing**:
- ✅ should remove workspace from registry
- ✅ should return false for non-existent workspace
- ✅ should persist removal to disk

**Note**: Requirement 4.2 (clearing active workspace when removing active one) will be implemented in Task 5.4 (workspace remove command), where the command handler coordinates between WorkspaceRegistry and GlobalConfig.

## Additional Features Implemented

Beyond the core CRUD operations, the implementation includes:

1. **Path Validation**: `validateWorkspacePath(path)` - Comprehensive validation
2. **Timestamp Management**: `updateLastAccessed(name)` - Track workspace usage
3. **Persistence**: Automatic save/load from `~/.kse/workspaces.json`
4. **Error Handling**: Clear, actionable error messages
5. **Cross-Platform Support**: Path normalization with forward slashes

## Test Results

**Total Tests**: 48 passed  
**Test File**: `tests/unit/workspace/multi-workspace-models.test.js`  
**Coverage**: All CRUD operations, edge cases, and error conditions

### Test Categories:
- Workspace Data Model: 12 tests ✅
- WorkspaceRegistry: 24 tests ✅
- GlobalConfig: 12 tests ✅

## Code Quality

✅ **Clear Documentation**: All methods have JSDoc comments  
✅ **Error Messages**: Descriptive with actionable suggestions  
✅ **Async/Await**: Proper async handling throughout  
✅ **Data Integrity**: Automatic persistence after modifications  
✅ **Separation of Concerns**: Registry manages workspaces, Config manages settings

## Architecture Notes

The implementation follows proper separation of concerns:

- **WorkspaceRegistry**: Manages workspace entries (CRUD operations)
- **GlobalConfig**: Manages global settings (active workspace, preferences)
- **Workspace**: Data model with serialization and path operations

This separation allows the command layer (Task 5) to coordinate between components for complex operations like removing the active workspace.

## Next Steps

Task 2 is complete. The next task (Task 3) is a checkpoint to ensure all tests pass, which has been verified. The implementation is ready for Task 4 (workspace context resolution) and Task 5 (CLI commands).

## Optional Tasks Skipped (As Per User Request)

For faster MVP delivery, the following optional property-based test tasks were skipped:
- 2.2 Write property tests for workspace creation
- 2.3 Write property test for duplicate prevention
- 2.5 Write property test for workspace listing
- 2.7 Write property tests for workspace removal

These can be added later for enhanced test coverage if needed.
