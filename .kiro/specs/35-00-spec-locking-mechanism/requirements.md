# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This document specifies the requirements for a Spec-level locking mechanism that prevents conflicts when multiple developers work on the same project. The system provides file-based locks to indicate when a Spec is being actively edited, allowing team members to see lock status and avoid simultaneous modifications to the same Spec.

## Glossary

- **Spec_Lock**: A file-based indicator that a Spec is currently being edited by a developer
- **Lock_Owner**: The developer or machine that currently holds the lock on a Spec
- **Lock_File**: A JSON file (`.lock`) stored in the Spec directory containing lock metadata
- **Lock_Timeout**: The maximum duration a lock can be held before it's considered stale
- **Stale_Lock**: A lock that has exceeded its timeout period and can be forcibly released
- **Lock_Manager**: The component responsible for acquiring, releasing, and querying locks
- **Machine_ID**: A unique identifier for the machine holding the lock
- **Lock_Metadata**: Information about the lock including owner, timestamp, and machine ID

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Lock Acquisition

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to acquire a lock on a Spec before editing, so that other developers know I'm working on it and won't make conflicting changes.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a developer runs `kse lock <spec-name>`, THE Lock_Manager SHALL create a Lock_File in the Spec directory
2. WHEN a Lock_File is created, THE Lock_Manager SHALL include Lock_Metadata with owner name, Machine_ID, timestamp, and optional reason
3. IF a Spec is already locked by another developer, THEN THE Lock_Manager SHALL reject the lock request and display the current Lock_Owner information
4. WHEN a lock is successfully acquired, THE Lock_Manager SHALL display a confirmation message with lock details
5. THE Lock_Manager SHALL support an optional `--reason` flag to document why the lock is being acquired

### Requirement 2: Lock Release

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to release a lock when I'm done editing, so that other developers can work on the Spec.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a developer runs `kse unlock <spec-name>`, THE Lock_Manager SHALL remove the Lock_File from the Spec directory
2. IF the lock is owned by a different Machine_ID, THEN THE Lock_Manager SHALL reject the unlock request unless `--force` flag is provided
3. WHEN `--force` flag is used, THE Lock_Manager SHALL release the lock regardless of ownership and log the forced release
4. WHEN a lock is successfully released, THE Lock_Manager SHALL display a confirmation message
5. IF no lock exists on the Spec, THEN THE Lock_Manager SHALL display an informational message

### Requirement 3: Lock Status Query

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to check the lock status of Specs, so that I can see which Specs are being edited and by whom.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a developer runs `kse lock status`, THE Lock_Manager SHALL display all locked Specs with their Lock_Metadata
2. WHEN a developer runs `kse lock status <spec-name>`, THE Lock_Manager SHALL display the lock status of the specific Spec
3. THE Lock_Manager SHALL display Lock_Owner, Machine_ID, lock timestamp, duration held, and reason (if provided)
4. THE Lock_Manager SHALL indicate if a lock is stale based on Lock_Timeout configuration
5. WHEN no Specs are locked, THE Lock_Manager SHALL display an informational message

### Requirement 4: Stale Lock Detection and Cleanup

**User Story:** As a team lead, I want stale locks to be automatically detected, so that abandoned locks don't block other developers indefinitely.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. THE Lock_Manager SHALL consider a lock stale if it exceeds the configured Lock_Timeout (default: 24 hours)
2. WHEN displaying lock status, THE Lock_Manager SHALL mark stale locks with a warning indicator
3. WHEN a developer runs `kse lock cleanup`, THE Lock_Manager SHALL remove all stale locks and report the cleanup results
4. THE Lock_Manager SHALL support configurable Lock_Timeout via project configuration
5. WHEN a stale lock is cleaned up, THE Lock_Manager SHALL log the cleanup action with original lock details

### Requirement 5: Lock File Format and Storage

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want lock files stored in a consistent format, so that they can be version-controlled and audited.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. THE Lock_Manager SHALL store Lock_Files as `.kiro/specs/<spec-name>/.lock` JSON files
2. THE Lock_File SHALL contain: owner (string), machineId (string), timestamp (ISO 8601), reason (optional string), timeout (number in hours)
3. WHEN writing Lock_Files, THE Lock_Manager SHALL validate JSON schema compliance
4. THE Lock_Manager SHALL use atomic file operations to prevent corruption during concurrent access
5. THE Lock_File SHALL be excluded from version control via .gitignore by default

### Requirement 6: Lock Integration with Spec Workflow

**User Story:** As a developer, I want lock status integrated into existing Spec commands, so that I'm warned when trying to edit a locked Spec.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN running `kse spec list`, THE System SHALL display lock status indicator for each Spec
2. WHEN running `kse spec edit <spec-name>` on a locked Spec, THE System SHALL display a warning with Lock_Owner information
3. THE System SHALL support `--ignore-lock` flag to bypass lock warnings for read-only operations
4. WHEN a Spec is locked by the current machine, THE System SHALL indicate "locked by you" in status displays
5. THE System SHALL not block read operations on locked Specs, only warn about potential conflicts

### Requirement 7: Machine Identification

**User Story:** As a developer working on multiple machines, I want each machine to have a unique identifier, so that locks can be properly attributed.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. THE Lock_Manager SHALL generate a unique Machine_ID on first use and persist it in user configuration
2. THE Machine_ID SHALL be a combination of hostname and a random UUID for uniqueness
3. WHEN displaying lock information, THE Lock_Manager SHALL show both Machine_ID and a human-readable hostname
4. THE Lock_Manager SHALL support `kse lock whoami` command to display current machine's identifier
5. IF Machine_ID cannot be determined, THEN THE Lock_Manager SHALL generate a temporary ID and warn the user

### Requirement 8: Lock Serialization and Deserialization

**User Story:** As a developer, I want lock data to be reliably stored and retrieved, so that lock state is consistent across operations.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN serializing Lock_Metadata to JSON, THE Lock_Manager SHALL produce valid JSON with all required fields
2. WHEN deserializing Lock_Metadata from JSON, THE Lock_Manager SHALL validate all required fields are present
3. FOR ALL valid Lock_Metadata objects, serializing then deserializing SHALL produce an equivalent object (round-trip property)
4. IF Lock_File contains invalid JSON, THEN THE Lock_Manager SHALL treat it as a corrupted lock and allow override
5. THE Lock_Manager SHALL handle missing optional fields gracefully with default values

### Requirement 9: Concurrent Access Handling

**User Story:** As a developer in a team, I want the lock system to handle concurrent access safely, so that race conditions don't cause data corruption.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN multiple processes attempt to acquire the same lock simultaneously, THE Lock_Manager SHALL ensure only one succeeds
2. THE Lock_Manager SHALL use file-based locking mechanisms to prevent race conditions
3. IF a lock acquisition fails due to concurrent access, THEN THE Lock_Manager SHALL retry with exponential backoff
4. THE Lock_Manager SHALL support a maximum retry count (default: 3) before failing
5. WHEN concurrent access is detected, THE Lock_Manager SHALL log the conflict for debugging

### Requirement 10: Backward Compatibility

**User Story:** As an existing user, I want the locking system to be optional, so that existing workflows continue to work without changes.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a Spec has no Lock_File, THE System SHALL treat it as unlocked and allow all operations
2. THE Lock_Manager SHALL not require locks for any existing Spec operations
3. WHEN lock commands are not used, THE System SHALL behave identically to previous versions
4. THE Lock_Manager SHALL provide clear documentation on enabling and using the locking feature
5. THE System SHALL maintain all existing Spec workflow behaviors for projects not using locks
