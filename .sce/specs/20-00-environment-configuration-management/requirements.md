# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This document specifies the requirements for the Environment Configuration Management feature in kse (kiro-spec-engine). This feature enables developers to manage multiple environment configurations (development, staging, production, etc.) within their projects, providing quick switching, validation, and execution capabilities across different environments.

The feature addresses the common pain point of manually managing multiple configuration files and switching between environments, which is error-prone and time-consuming. By integrating environment management into kse's workflow, developers can maintain consistency and reduce configuration-related errors.

## Glossary

- **Environment**: A named configuration context (e.g., "local-151", "production") that defines a set of configuration files and validation rules
- **Environment_Manager**: The system component responsible for managing environment configurations
- **Config_File_Mapping**: A source-to-target file mapping that defines which configuration file should be copied where during environment switching
- **Active_Environment**: The currently selected environment configuration
- **Environment_Registry**: The persistent storage of all registered environments (`.sce/environments.json`)
- **Verification_Rule**: A command and expected output pattern used to validate environment configuration
- **Backup_System**: The component that creates backups before environment switches and supports rollback
- **CLI_Interface**: The command-line interface for environment management operations

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Environment Registration

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to register multiple environment configurations, so that I can manage different deployment contexts in my project.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a developer registers a new environment, THE Environment_Manager SHALL store the environment configuration in the Environment_Registry
2. WHEN registering an environment, THE Environment_Manager SHALL validate that the environment name is unique within the project
3. WHEN registering an environment, THE Environment_Manager SHALL validate that all source configuration files exist
4. THE Environment_Manager SHALL support registering environments with multiple config file mappings
5. WHERE an environment includes verification rules, THE Environment_Manager SHALL store the verification command and expected output pattern
6. WHEN the Environment_Registry does not exist, THE Environment_Manager SHALL create it with proper JSON structure

### Requirement 2: Environment Listing and Information Display

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to view all registered environments and their details, so that I can understand what environments are available and their current status.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a developer requests environment listing, THE CLI_Interface SHALL display all registered environments with their names and descriptions
2. WHEN displaying environment list, THE CLI_Interface SHALL indicate which environment is currently active
3. WHEN a developer requests environment information, THE CLI_Interface SHALL display the active environment's configuration details including config file mappings and verification rules
4. WHEN no environments are registered, THE CLI_Interface SHALL display a helpful message guiding the user to register an environment
5. WHEN displaying environment details, THE CLI_Interface SHALL show the source and target paths for each config file mapping

### Requirement 3: Environment Switching

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to quickly switch between environments, so that I can work with different configurations without manual file copying.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a developer switches to a registered environment, THE Environment_Manager SHALL copy all source configuration files to their target locations
2. WHEN switching environments, THE Backup_System SHALL create backups of existing target files before overwriting them
3. WHEN a switch operation completes successfully, THE Environment_Manager SHALL update the active_environment field in the Environment_Registry
4. IF a source configuration file does not exist during switching, THEN THE Environment_Manager SHALL report an error and abort the switch operation
5. IF a target directory does not exist during switching, THEN THE Environment_Manager SHALL create the directory before copying files
6. WHEN switching environments, THE Environment_Manager SHALL preserve file permissions of the source files

### Requirement 4: Environment Verification

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to verify that my current environment is correctly configured, so that I can catch configuration errors early.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a developer requests environment verification, THE Environment_Manager SHALL execute the verification command defined for the active environment
2. WHEN verification command output matches the expected pattern, THE CLI_Interface SHALL report verification success
3. WHEN verification command output does not match the expected pattern, THE CLI_Interface SHALL report verification failure with details
4. IF the active environment has no verification rules defined, THEN THE CLI_Interface SHALL report that verification is not configured
5. WHEN verification command execution fails, THE Environment_Manager SHALL capture and display the error output

### Requirement 5: Environment Context Execution

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to run commands in a specific environment context, so that I can ensure commands use the correct configuration.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a developer runs a command with environment context, THE Environment_Manager SHALL ensure the specified environment is active before command execution
2. WHEN executing a command in environment context, THE CLI_Interface SHALL display which environment is being used
3. WHEN the command execution completes, THE CLI_Interface SHALL display the command output and exit code
4. IF the specified environment does not exist, THEN THE Environment_Manager SHALL report an error and not execute the command
5. WHEN running commands in environment context, THE Environment_Manager SHALL preserve the current working directory

### Requirement 6: Backup and Rollback

**User Story:** As a developer, I want automatic backups when switching environments, so that I can recover from configuration mistakes.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN switching environments, THE Backup_System SHALL create timestamped backups of all target files that will be overwritten
2. WHEN a developer requests rollback, THE Backup_System SHALL restore the most recent backup for each target file
3. WHEN creating backups, THE Backup_System SHALL store them in a `.sce/env-backups/` directory with timestamp and environment name
4. WHEN restoring backups, THE Backup_System SHALL update the active_environment to reflect the restored state
5. WHEN backup directory does not exist, THE Backup_System SHALL create it before storing backups
6. THE Backup_System SHALL maintain a maximum of 10 backups per target file, removing oldest backups when limit is exceeded

### Requirement 7: Multi-Workspace Integration

**User Story:** As a developer using multiple workspaces, I want each workspace to have independent environment configurations, so that different projects don't interfere with each other.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN operating in a workspace context, THE Environment_Manager SHALL use the workspace-specific Environment_Registry
2. WHEN no workspace is active, THE Environment_Manager SHALL use the project-level Environment_Registry
3. WHEN switching workspaces, THE Environment_Manager SHALL automatically load the new workspace's environment configuration
4. THE Environment_Manager SHALL store workspace-specific environment registries in `.sce/workspaces/{workspace-name}/environments.json`
5. WHEN a workspace is created, THE Environment_Manager SHALL initialize an empty Environment_Registry for that workspace

### Requirement 8: Cross-Platform Support

**User Story:** As a developer working on different operating systems, I want environment management to work consistently across Windows, Linux, and Mac, so that I can use the same workflows everywhere.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. THE Environment_Manager SHALL use platform-independent path handling for all file operations
2. WHEN copying configuration files, THE Environment_Manager SHALL handle line ending differences appropriately for the target platform
3. WHEN executing verification commands, THE Environment_Manager SHALL use the appropriate shell for the current platform
4. THE CLI_Interface SHALL provide consistent command syntax across all platforms
5. WHEN displaying file paths, THE CLI_Interface SHALL use the native path separator for the current platform

### Requirement 9: Configuration File Format

**User Story:** As a developer, I want a clear and maintainable configuration file format, so that I can easily understand and modify environment configurations.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. THE Environment_Registry SHALL use JSON format for storing environment configurations
2. THE Environment_Registry SHALL include a version field for future compatibility
3. WHEN parsing the Environment_Registry, THE Environment_Manager SHALL validate the JSON structure against a schema
4. IF the Environment_Registry is corrupted or invalid, THEN THE Environment_Manager SHALL report a clear error message
5. THE Environment_Registry SHALL support comments through a "description" field for each environment

### Requirement 10: Error Handling and User Feedback

**User Story:** As a developer, I want clear error messages and feedback, so that I can quickly understand and fix configuration issues.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN an operation fails, THE CLI_Interface SHALL display a clear error message explaining what went wrong
2. WHEN an operation succeeds, THE CLI_Interface SHALL display a success message with relevant details
3. IF a required file is missing, THEN THE CLI_Interface SHALL display the expected file path
4. WHEN validation fails, THE CLI_Interface SHALL display both expected and actual output
5. WHEN displaying errors, THE CLI_Interface SHALL use color coding (red for errors, green for success, yellow for warnings) where terminal supports it
