## 📖 Full Article

Read the complete dialogue: [The Philosophy and Practice of AI-Driven Development](https://github.com/heguangyong/kiro-spec-engine/blob/main/docs/articles/ai-driven-development-philosophy-and-practice.en.md)

## 🎯 Core Perspectives

This is an in-depth dialogue about AI development trends, exploring:

1. **Paradigm Shift**: AI evolving from "passive feeding" to "proactive exploration" to "principle-driven engines"
2. **Philosophical Foundation**: Neo-Confucianism's "unity of knowledge and action" (知行合一) and Yogacara Buddhism's "dependent origination and cessation" (緣起緣滅) provide theoretical support for AI practice
3. **Practical Implementation**: kiro-spec-engine transforms concepts into operable engineering practice
4. **Future Outlook**: AI becomes the center of the information world, with human experts becoming "meta-experts"

## 💡 Key Insights

- **Logic is the rope of thought**: Language is the world, nothing exists outside the mind
- **Cycles themselves are the rope of logic**: Dependent origination and cessation, no need for additional human external ropes
- **Bias is the norm**: Frozen forms and true nature, activation and transformation
- **Using spec-driven external form to guard inner non-being**

## 🚀 Practical Project

These concepts are practiced in [kiro-spec-engine](https://github.com/heguangyong/kiro-spec-engine):

- Precisely solving session context consumption problems
- Document-driven + automated governance
- Natural implementation of high cohesion, low coupling
- Leverage point for principle-driven Agents
- Ultrawork spirit + Sisyphus metaphor

## 📚 Dialogue Highlights

The dialogue covers 7 rounds of deep exchange:

1. **AI Development Trends**: AI will become the center of the information world
2. **MCP Clarification**: The role positioning of Model Context Protocol
3. **2000+ Hours of Practice**: Evolution from passive feeding to proactive exploration
4. **Philosophical Foundations**: Logic, language, Neo-Confucianism, and project evolution
5. **Session Limitations**: Cyclical properties and segmentation strategies
6. **kiro-spec-engine**: Productization of the concept into practice
7. **Steering Rules**: Regional design and timeliness management

## 🌏 About Chinese Philosophy

For readers unfamiliar with Chinese philosophy, the article includes a glossary explaining key terms:

- **知行合一** (*zhī xíng hé yī*): Unity of knowledge and action
- **心外無物** (*xīn wài wú wù*): Nothing exists outside the mind
- **致良知** (*zhì liáng zhī*): Extending innate knowledge
- **阿賴耶識** (*ālàiyēshí*): Alaya-consciousness (storehouse consciousness)
- **緣起緣滅** (*yuán qǐ yuán miè*): Dependent origination and cessation

## 🤔 Discussion Topics

Welcome to discuss:

1. How do you view the role transformation of AI in software development?
2. What challenges have you encountered when using AI for programming?
3. How do you think the "principle-driven Agent" concept can be applied to actual projects?
4. What solutions do you have for session context limitations?
