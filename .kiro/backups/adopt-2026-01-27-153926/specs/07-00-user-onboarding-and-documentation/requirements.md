# Requirements Document

## Introduction

kse (Kiro Spec Engine) is a CLI tool that manages Specs (requirements, design, tasks) and provides structured context for AI coding tools (Cursor, Claude Code, Windsurf, Kiro, VS Code plugins, etc.). This specification addresses the need to improve documentation and user onboarding to help users quickly understand and effectively use kse with their preferred AI tools.

The current documentation, while comprehensive, presents too much information at once for new users and lacks tool-specific guidance. Users need clear, focused documentation that helps them get started within 5 minutes and understand how to integrate kse with their specific AI development environment.

## Glossary

- **kse**: Kiro Spec Engine, the CLI tool for managing Specs and providing context to AI tools
- **Spec**: A feature specification consisting of requirements.md, design.md, and tasks.md
- **AI_Tool**: Any AI-powered coding assistant (Cursor, Claude Code, Windsurf, Kiro, VS Code Copilot, etc.)
- **Context_Provider**: The role of kse in providing structured information to AI tools
- **Integration_Mode**: The method by which kse integrates with AI tools (native, manual export, watch mode)
- **User**: A developer using kse with an AI tool
- **Documentation_System**: The complete set of documentation files for kse
- **Quick_Start**: The process of creating and using the first Spec within 5 minutes
- **Tool_Guide**: Documentation specific to using kse with a particular AI tool
- **Workflow_Diagram**: Visual representation of kse processes and integration patterns
