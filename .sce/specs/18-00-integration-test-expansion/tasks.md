# Implementation Plan: Integration Test Expansion

## Overview

This implementation plan breaks down the integration test expansion into discrete, manageable tasks. The approach follows the existing test patterns from `watch-mode-integration.test.js` and focuses on creating reusable test fixtures and utilities before implementing individual command tests.

The implementation is organized to maximize efficiency: shared utilities first, then tests grouped by functional area, with checkpoints to ensure quality at each stage.

## Notes

- Each test file should follow the patterns established in `watch-mode-integration.test.js`
- Use real file system operations (fs-extra) rather than mocks
- Ensure proper cleanup in afterEach hooks to prevent test pollution
- Group related tests to share fixtures and improve performance
- Set appropriate timeouts for long-running tests (15000ms)
- Include clear error messages for debugging test failures
- All test fixtures should be created in `tests/fixtures/integration-test/` subdirectories
- Use unique directory names per test to enable parallel execution
