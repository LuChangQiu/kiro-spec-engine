# Implementation Plan: Scene Package Gate Remediation Plan Closure

## Tasks

- [x] 1 Implement remediation builder for gate evaluation output
  - Added gate failed-check to remediation action synthesis logic.
  - Added action dedupe and fallback action generation.

- [x] 2 Integrate remediation payload into package-gate command output
  - Added `remediation` field to `scene package-gate` JSON payload.
  - Added summary printing of remediation action count and top actions.

- [x] 3 Extend gate tests for remediation assertions
  - Added pass-path assertions for empty remediation payload.
  - Added fail-path assertions for deterministic remediation action IDs.

- [x] 4 Capture remediation smoke outputs and closure artifacts
  - Executed gate smoke run against three-layer policy and archived output.
  - Captured pass-path smoke run to verify zero-action remediation behavior.

- [x] 5 Run full verification and status checks
  - Executed `npx jest tests/unit/commands/scene.test.js --runInBand`.
  - Executed `npm test -- --runInBand`, `kse doctor --docs`, and `kse status`.
