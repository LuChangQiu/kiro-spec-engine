2. Task queue and execution management
3. Error recovery system
4. Decision engine and progress tracking
5. Checkpoint and rollback capabilities
6. CLI commands and user interface
7. Integration with existing features
8. Testing and documentation

- Integration tests validate end-to-end workflows
- The implementation follows an incremental approach, building infrastructure first then adding capabilities
- All code should follow existing kse patterns and conventions
- Safety and user control are prioritized throughout implementation
