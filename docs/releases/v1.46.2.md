# Release Notes: v1.46.2

Release date: 2026-02-14

## Highlights

- Added KPI observability commands for real delivery measurement:
  - `kse value metrics snapshot`
  - `kse value metrics baseline`
  - `kse value metrics trend`
- Added first-run scaffold command:
  - `kse value metrics sample`
- Improved operator experience:
  - Actionable failure guidance now points to concrete next commands.
- Strengthened product positioning:
  - README, quick-start, and docs index now clearly express kse advantages.
- Refreshed onboarding consistency:
  - `START_HERE.txt`, `INSTALL_OFFLINE.txt`, and `docs/OFFLINE_INSTALL.md` now align with current version and workflow.
- Improved package hygiene:
  - Excluded Python bytecode artifacts from npm package contents.

## Why This Release Matters

This release shifts kse from "workflow tooling" to "measurable delivery system":

- You can now produce weekly, machine-readable KPI evidence.
- You can compare baseline vs trend for risk review.
- You can use gate-ready outputs for Day30/Day60 decisions.

## Quick Verification

```bash
kse adopt
kse spec bootstrap --name 01-00-demo-feature --non-interactive
kse value metrics sample --out ./kpi-input.json --json
kse value metrics snapshot --input ./kpi-input.json --json
```

## Upgrade Notes

- Runtime requirement remains: Node.js >= 16.
- Existing workflows remain backward-compatible.
- If you already use value metrics commands, `sample` is additive and optional.
