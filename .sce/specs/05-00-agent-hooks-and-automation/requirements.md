# Requirements Document: Agent Hooks and Cross-Tool Automation

## Introduction

This document specifies requirements for implementing agent hooks in Kiro IDE and equivalent automation mechanisms for other AI coding tools (Claude Code, Cursor, GitHub Copilot, etc.). The goal is to provide consistent automation capabilities across all supported tools, with Kiro IDE offering the most seamless experience through native hooks, while other tools get equivalent functionality through alternative mechanisms.

## Glossary

- **Agent Hooks**: Kiro IDE's native event-driven automation system
- **Automation Equivalent**: Alternative mechanisms to achieve similar automation in non-Kiro tools
- **Watch Mode**: File system monitoring for automatic command execution
- **Manual Workflow**: Step-by-step instructions for tools without automation
- **Hook Template**: Pre-configured hook for common use cases
- **Fallback Strategy**: Alternative approach when native hooks unavailable

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Kiro IDE Agent Hooks Implementation

**User Story:** As a Kiro IDE user, I want agent hooks to automate repetitive tasks, so that I can focus on coding instead of manual commands.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I run `kse hooks init`, THE System SHALL create `.sce/hooks/` directory with default hook templates
2. THE System SHALL provide at least 5 pre-configured hook templates for common use cases
3. WHEN a hook event occurs, THE System SHALL execute the configured action automatically
4. THE System SHALL log all hook executions to `.sce/hooks/execution.log`
5. THE System SHALL provide `kse hooks list/enable/disable/test` commands for hook management

### Requirement 2: File Watcher for Non-Kiro Tools

**User Story:** As a developer using Claude Code or Cursor, I want automatic file monitoring, so that I can get similar automation benefits without Kiro IDE.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I run `kse watch start`, THE System SHALL start monitoring specified file patterns
2. WHEN a monitored file changes, THE System SHALL execute configured commands automatically
3. THE System SHALL support watching tasks.md, requirements.md, design.md, and source files
4. THE System SHALL run in background and survive terminal restarts
5. THE System SHALL provide `kse watch stop/status/logs` commands for management

### Requirement 3: Manual Workflow Documentation

**User Story:** As a developer using tools without automation, I want clear step-by-step workflows, so that I can achieve the same results manually.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. FOR each Kiro IDE hook, THE System SHALL provide equivalent functionality for other tools
2. THE System SHALL document feature parity in a comparison table
3. THE System SHALL provide migration guides between tools
4. THE System SHALL detect current tool and suggest appropriate automation setup
5. THE System SHALL maintain consistent behavior across all automation mechanisms

### Requirement 5: Hook Templates and Presets

**User Story:** As a new kse user, I want pre-configured automation templates, so that I can start using automation without complex configuration.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. THE System SHALL provide templates for: auto-sync, quality-gate, context-export, prompt-gen, test-runner
2. WHEN I run `kse hooks install <template>`, THE System SHALL install the template with sensible defaults
3. THE System SHALL allow customization of installed templates
4. THE System SHALL provide template descriptions and use case explanations
5. THE System SHALL support community-contributed templates

### Requirement 6: Automation Configuration Management

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to manage automation settings easily, so that I can enable/disable features as needed.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. THE System SHALL store automation config in `.sce/automation-config.json`
2. THE System SHALL provide `kse automation status` to show current configuration
3. THE System SHALL allow enabling/disabling automation per tool
4. THE System SHALL support project-level and user-level configuration
5. THE System SHALL validate configuration and provide helpful error messages

### Requirement 7: Watch Mode Implementation

**User Story:** As a developer using non-Kiro tools, I want a watch mode that monitors files, so that I get automatic command execution.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN watch mode detects tasks.md changes, THE System SHALL run `kse workspace sync`
2. WHEN watch mode detects spec file changes, THE System SHALL regenerate prompts
3. THE System SHALL debounce file changes to avoid excessive executions
4. THE System SHALL provide configurable watch patterns and commands
5. THE System SHALL run watch mode as a background process

### Requirement 8: Automation Metrics and Logging

**User Story:** As a team lead, I want to see automation metrics, so that I can measure productivity improvements.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. THE System SHALL track number of automated executions per day
2. THE System SHALL estimate time saved by automation
3. THE System SHALL log all automation events with timestamps
4. THE System SHALL provide `kse automation metrics` command to view statistics
5. THE System SHALL support exporting metrics to CSV or JSON

### Requirement 9: Error Handling and Recovery

**User Story:** As a developer, I want automation to handle errors gracefully, so that failures don't disrupt my workflow.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN an automated command fails, THE System SHALL log the error and continue
2. THE System SHALL retry failed commands up to 3 times with exponential backoff
3. THE System SHALL notify user of persistent failures
4. THE System SHALL provide `kse automation errors` command to view recent failures
5. THE System SHALL allow disabling problematic automations without affecting others

### Requirement 10: Tool Detection and Auto-Configuration

**User Story:** As a new user, I want kse to detect my tool and configure automation automatically, so that I get the best experience without manual setup.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I run `kse adopt`, THE System SHALL detect if I'm using Kiro IDE
2. IF Kiro IDE is detected, THE System SHALL offer to install agent hooks
3. IF other tools are detected, THE System SHALL offer to setup watch mode or manual workflows
4. THE System SHALL provide tool-specific setup instructions
5. THE System SHALL allow switching automation modes later

## Non-Functional Requirements

### Performance

- Watch mode SHALL consume < 50MB memory

- The System SHALL gracefully degrade when features unavailable

### Reliability

- Watch mode SHALL automatically restart after crashes
- Hook execution SHALL be atomic and not leave partial state
- The System SHALL handle concurrent file changes correctly
- Automation logs SHALL be rotated to prevent disk space issues

## Success Metrics

### Adoption Metrics

- 60%+ of Kiro IDE users enable agent hooks
- 40%+ of non-Kiro users enable watch mode
- 80%+ of users find automation helpful (survey)

### Productivity Metrics

- 20-30% faster task completion
- 50%+ reduction in forgotten sync operations

### Quality Metrics

- 90%+ automation success rate
- < 1% false positive triggers
- < 5 seconds average automation latency

## Constraints

### Technical Constraints

- Agent hooks only available in Kiro IDE
- Watch mode requires Node.js file system APIs
- Background processes require OS support
- File watching has OS-specific limitations

### Business Constraints

- Must maintain backward compatibility
- Must not require additional dependencies
- Must work offline
- Must respect user privacy (no telemetry without consent)

## Assumptions

- Users have Node.js 14+ installed
- Users have write permissions to project directory
- File system supports file watching (most modern systems do)
- Users understand basic CLI commands

## Dependencies

- Kiro IDE agent hooks API (for Kiro-specific features)
- Node.js `chokidar` library (for file watching)
- Node.js `child_process` (for command execution)
- Existing kse CLI commands

## Risks and Mitigation

- Provide sensible defaults
- Offer pre-configured templates
- Include setup wizard

### Risk: Cross-tool inconsistency

**Mitigation**:

### Risk: User confusion about automation

**Mitigation**:
