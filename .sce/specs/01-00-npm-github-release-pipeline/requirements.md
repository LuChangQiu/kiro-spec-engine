# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This specification defines the requirements for establishing a complete release pipeline for the kiro-spec-engine project. The system shall enable seamless publishing to both GitHub and npm, with automated testing, quality assurance, and user-friendly installation experience. The pipeline must support the dual-language architecture (Node.js CLI + Python tools) while providing clear guidance for users in both English and Chinese.

## Glossary

- **CLI**: Command Line Interface - the Node.js-based command-line tool
- **Ultrawork_Enhancer**: The Python-based quality enhancement tool
- **Release_Pipeline**: The automated workflow for testing, building, and publishing releases
- **Package_Manager**: npm (Node Package Manager) used for distributing the CLI tool
- **Repository**: The GitHub repository hosting the project source code
- **CI/CD**: Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment automation system
- **Dependency_Check**: Validation that required runtime dependencies (Python) are available
- **Version_Tag**: Git tag marking a specific release version (e.g., v1.0.0)
