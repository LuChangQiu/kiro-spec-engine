# Requirements Document: AI Autonomous Control

## Introduction

This feature transforms kse from a step-by-step interactive tool into an autonomous development assistant. Building on Principle 4.1 "完全自主执行权限", this feature enables AI to independently manage the entire development lifecycle - from understanding user goals to delivering working features - with minimal human intervention.

The autonomous control system will handle Spec creation, requirements analysis, design decisions, implementation, testing, debugging, and quality assurance automatically. Users will only be consulted at critical checkpoints or when external resources are needed.

## Glossary

- **Autonomous_Engine**: The core system that manages autonomous task execution, error recovery, and decision-making
- **Task_Queue**: A managed queue of tasks to be executed autonomously with priority and dependency tracking
- **Checkpoint**: A predefined pause point where AI requests user validation before proceeding
- **Error_Recovery_Strategy**: A systematic approach to analyzing and resolving errors without user intervention
- **Execution_Context**: The accumulated knowledge and state maintained throughout autonomous execution
