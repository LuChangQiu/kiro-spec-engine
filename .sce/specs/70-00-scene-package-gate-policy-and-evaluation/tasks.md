# Implementation Plan: Scene Package Gate Policy and Evaluation

## Tasks

- [x] 1 Add package-gate-template and package-gate command interface
  - Registered command entries with policy profile and strict evaluation options.
  - Added normalize/validate option handlers for both command flows.

- [x] 2 Implement policy template generation and profile model
  - Added `kse.scene.package-gate/v0.1` policy template model.
  - Added baseline and three-layer profile presets with overwrite safety.

- [x] 3 Implement registry gate evaluation pipeline
  - Added gate evaluator for thresholds and layer coverage checks.
  - Added JSON/human-readable summary output and strict non-zero behavior.

- [x] 4 Extend tests for gate template/evaluation scenarios
  - Added option validation tests for gate template and gate commands.
  - Added pass/fail runtime tests including strict-mode failure path.

- [x] 5 Run verification and capture reports
  - Executed `npx jest tests/unit/commands/scene.test.js --runInBand`.
  - Captured gate policy and evaluation smoke outputs in reports.
  - Executed full regression and document compliance/status checks.
