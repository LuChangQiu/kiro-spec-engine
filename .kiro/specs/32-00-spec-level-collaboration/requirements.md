# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This document specifies the requirements for a Spec-level parallel collaboration system that enables multiple AI instances (Kiro) to work on different Specs simultaneously within a large project. The system provides dependency management, interface contracts, status tracking, and integration testing capabilities to coordinate parallel development efforts.

## Glossary

- **Master_Spec**: A high-level Spec that defines the overall feature and breaks it down into multiple Sub_Specs
- **Sub_Spec**: A child Spec that implements a specific module or component of the Master_Spec
- **Spec_Dependency**: A relationship where one Spec requires another Spec to be completed before it can start or be integrated
- **Interface_Contract**: A formal definition of the APIs, data structures, and behaviors that a Spec provides or consumes
- **Kiro_Instance**: An AI assistant instance working on a specific Spec
- **Spec_Status**: The current state of a Spec (not-started, in-progress, completed, blocked)
- **Integration_Test**: A test that verifies multiple Specs work together correctly
- **Collaboration_Metadata**: JSON files storing Spec relationships, assignments, and contracts

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Spec Dependency Management

**User Story:** As an architect, I want to define dependencies between Specs, so that I can ensure Specs are developed in the correct order and integration is smooth.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user creates a Master_Spec, THE System SHALL allow defining Sub_Specs with dependency relationships
2. WHEN a dependency is defined, THE System SHALL validate that no circular dependencies exist
3. WHEN querying Spec status, THE System SHALL identify which Specs are ready to start based on completed dependencies
4. WHEN a Spec is marked completed, THE System SHALL update the status of dependent Specs
5. THE System SHALL support multiple dependency types (requires-completion, requires-interface, optional)

### Requirement 2: Spec Assignment and Status Tracking

**User Story:** As a project manager, I want to assign Specs to different Kiro instances and track their progress, so that I can coordinate parallel development and identify blockers.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a Sub_Spec is created, THE System SHALL allow assigning it to a Kiro_Instance identifier
2. WHEN a Spec status changes, THE System SHALL persist the new status to Collaboration_Metadata
3. WHEN querying project status, THE System SHALL display all Specs with their current status and assigned Kiro_Instance
4. WHEN a Spec is blocked, THE System SHALL record the blocking reason and notify dependent Specs
5. THE System SHALL support reassigning a Spec to a different Kiro_Instance

### Requirement 3: Interface Contract Definition

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to define interface contracts between Specs, so that different Kiro instances can develop independently while ensuring compatibility.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a Spec provides an API or module, THE System SHALL allow defining an Interface_Contract in JSON or TypeScript format
2. WHEN an Interface_Contract is defined, THE System SHALL validate the contract syntax and completeness
3. WHEN a Spec consumes an interface, THE System SHALL reference the providing Spec's Interface_Contract
4. THE System SHALL support versioning of Interface_Contracts to track changes
5. WHEN an Interface_Contract changes, THE System SHALL identify all consuming Specs that may be affected

### Requirement 4: Interface Contract Verification

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the system to verify that implementations match interface contracts, so that integration issues are caught early.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a Spec implementation is completed, THE System SHALL validate that exported interfaces match the defined Interface_Contract
2. WHEN an interface mismatch is detected, THE System SHALL report specific differences (missing methods, type mismatches, signature changes)
3. THE System SHALL support automated verification for JavaScript/TypeScript interfaces
4. WHEN a breaking change is detected, THE System SHALL mark the Spec status as requiring-review
5. THE System SHALL generate a verification report showing contract compliance status

### Requirement 5: Spec Integration Testing

**User Story:** As a quality engineer, I want to define and run integration tests between Specs, so that I can verify that independently developed modules work together correctly.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN multiple dependent Specs are completed, THE System SHALL allow defining Integration_Tests that span multiple Specs
2. WHEN an Integration_Test is defined, THE System SHALL validate that all required Specs are available
3. WHEN running integration tests, THE System SHALL execute tests and collect results from all involved Specs
4. WHEN integration tests fail, THE System SHALL identify which Spec interfaces are causing failures
5. THE System SHALL generate an integration test report showing cross-Spec compatibility status

### Requirement 6: Spec Breakdown Planning

**User Story:** As an architect, I want to create a Master Spec with a breakdown plan, so that I can decompose large features into manageable Sub-Specs for parallel development.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN creating a Master_Spec, THE System SHALL allow defining a breakdown structure with multiple Sub_Specs
2. WHEN a breakdown is defined, THE System SHALL generate Sub_Spec templates with proper metadata and traceability
3. WHEN a Sub_Spec is generated, THE System SHALL include references to the Master_Spec and sibling Sub_Specs
4. THE System SHALL support hierarchical Spec structures (Master → Sub → Sub-Sub)
5. WHEN querying a Master_Spec, THE System SHALL display the complete breakdown tree with status of all Sub_Specs

### Requirement 7: Collaboration Metadata Management

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want collaboration metadata stored in version-controlled JSON files, so that the collaboration state is persistent and auditable.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. THE System SHALL store Collaboration_Metadata in `.kiro/specs/{spec-name}/collaboration.json` files
2. WHEN Collaboration_Metadata is updated, THE System SHALL validate JSON schema compliance
3. THE System SHALL support atomic updates to prevent corruption during concurrent access
4. WHEN a Spec is deleted, THE System SHALL clean up related Collaboration_Metadata and update dependent Specs
5. THE System SHALL provide a command to validate all Collaboration_Metadata consistency across the project

### Requirement 8: CLI Commands for Collaboration

**User Story:** As a developer, I want CLI commands to manage Spec collaboration, so that I can easily create, query, and update collaboration metadata.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. THE System SHALL provide a `kse collab init` command to initialize a Master_Spec with Sub_Specs
2. THE System SHALL provide a `kse collab status` command to display all Specs with dependencies and assignments
3. THE System SHALL provide a `kse collab assign` command to assign a Spec to a Kiro_Instance
4. THE System SHALL provide a `kse collab verify` command to validate interface contracts and dependencies
5. THE System SHALL provide a `kse collab integrate` command to run integration tests across Specs

### Requirement 9: Dependency Visualization

**User Story:** As a project manager, I want to visualize Spec dependencies, so that I can understand the project structure and identify critical paths.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN running `kse collab status --graph`, THE System SHALL generate a text-based dependency graph
2. THE System SHALL use different symbols to represent Spec_Status (✓ completed, ⧗ in-progress, ○ not-started, ✗ blocked)
3. THE System SHALL show dependency arrows between Specs
4. THE System SHALL highlight the critical path (longest dependency chain)
5. THE System SHALL support exporting the graph in Mermaid format for documentation

### Requirement 10: Backward Compatibility

**User Story:** As an existing user, I want the collaboration system to be optional, so that single-Spec workflows continue to work without changes.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a Spec has no collaboration.json file, THE System SHALL treat it as a standalone Spec
2. WHEN running existing commands, THE System SHALL not require Collaboration_Metadata
3. THE System SHALL only activate collaboration features when collaboration.json exists
4. WHEN migrating to collaboration mode, THE System SHALL provide a migration command
5. THE System SHALL maintain all existing Spec workflow behaviors for non-collaborative Specs
