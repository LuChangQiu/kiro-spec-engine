# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This Spec addresses the misalignment between kiro-spec-engine's current positioning as an "AI autonomy enabler" and its documentation, which still contains manual, tool-centric instructions. The goal is to systematically update all documentation to reflect that AI agents autonomously use kse as invisible infrastructure, while users simply express intent.

## Glossary

- **Documentation_System**: The complete set of user-facing documentation files in the kiro-spec-engine project
- **AI_Agent**: An AI assistant (like Kiro, Codex, Claude) that autonomously uses kse to manage development workflows
- **User**: A human developer who expresses intent to AI agents rather than manually running commands
- **Manual_Language**: Documentation that instructs users to run commands or create files manually
- **Autonomy_Language**: Documentation that describes how AI agents autonomously handle tasks based on user intent
- **Tool_Guide**: Documentation files in docs/tools/ that describe kse command capabilities
- **Workflow_Guide**: Documentation that describes development processes and methodologies

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Documentation Audit and Classification

**User Story:** As a documentation maintainer, I want to identify all instances of manual-centric language, so that I can systematically update them to reflect AI autonomy.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the Documentation_System is analyzed, THE System SHALL identify all files containing manual Spec creation instructions
2. WHEN the Documentation_System is analyzed, THE System SHALL identify all instances of "you create/run/execute" language patterns
3. WHEN the Documentation_System is analyzed, THE System SHALL identify all step-by-step command tutorials
4. WHEN the Documentation_System is analyzed, THE System SHALL classify each file by severity (high/medium/low impact on user perception)
5. WHEN the audit is complete, THE System SHALL generate a comprehensive report listing all affected files and specific line numbers

### Requirement 2: Documentation Principles Definition

**User Story:** As a documentation writer, I want clear principles for AI-autonomy-focused documentation, so that I can write consistently across all files.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. THE Documentation_System SHALL define principles distinguishing Manual_Language from Autonomy_Language
2. THE Documentation_System SHALL provide before/after examples for common documentation patterns
3. THE Documentation_System SHALL specify when technical command details are appropriate versus when to emphasize AI autonomy
4. THE Documentation_System SHALL define guidelines for Tool_Guide structure that balances AI autonomy with technical reference
5. THE Documentation_System SHALL establish consistency rules for English and Chinese documentation

### Requirement 3: Core Documentation Updates

**User Story:** As a new user, I want the main README and getting started guides to clearly communicate that AI handles kse autonomously, so that I understand my role is to express intent.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user reads README.md, THE Documentation SHALL emphasize "tell AI what you want" over "run these commands"
2. WHEN a user reads the "How it Works" section, THE Documentation SHALL describe AI agent behavior, not user manual steps
3. WHEN a user reads getting started instructions, THE Documentation SHALL focus on expressing intent to AI agents
4. WHEN a user reads README.zh.md, THE Documentation SHALL convey the same AI autonomy message in Chinese
5. WHEN core documentation is updated, THE Documentation SHALL preserve all technical accuracy while changing perspective

### Requirement 4: Tool Guide Restructuring

**User Story:** As an AI agent, I want tool guides that describe command capabilities and use cases, so that I can autonomously decide when to use each command.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN Tool_Guides are restructured, THE Documentation SHALL remove all "Step 1, Step 2" manual instructions
2. WHEN Tool_Guides describe commands, THE Documentation SHALL focus on "what this enables AI to do" rather than "how you run this"
3. WHEN Tool_Guides provide examples, THE Documentation SHALL show AI agent usage patterns, not user command execution
4. WHEN Tool_Guides are updated, THE Documentation SHALL maintain complete technical reference information
5. WHEN Tool_Guides are restructured, THE Documentation SHALL apply changes consistently across all 6 tool guide files

### Requirement 5: Workflow Guide Transformation

**User Story:** As a user, I want workflow guides that explain methodologies and outcomes, so that I can understand what to ask AI for without needing to know implementation details.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN Workflow_Guides are transformed, THE Documentation SHALL replace manual checklists with outcome-focused descriptions
2. WHEN Workflow_Guides describe processes, THE Documentation SHALL emphasize "what AI does for you" over "what you must do"
3. WHEN Workflow_Guides provide guidance, THE Documentation SHALL focus on intent expression patterns
4. WHEN spec-workflow.md is updated, THE Documentation SHALL describe the Spec-driven methodology without manual Spec creation steps
5. WHEN manual-workflows-guide.md is updated, THE Documentation SHALL reframe manual workflows as AI-assisted processes

### Requirement 6: Support Documentation Updates

**User Story:** As a user seeking help, I want FAQ and troubleshooting docs that guide me to express problems to AI, so that AI can autonomously resolve issues.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN FAQ entries are updated, THE Documentation SHALL change answers from "run this command" to "tell AI about this problem"
2. WHEN troubleshooting guides are updated, THE Documentation SHALL focus on symptom description rather than manual diagnostic steps
3. WHEN support documentation provides solutions, THE Documentation SHALL describe what AI will do to resolve issues
4. WHEN error scenarios are documented, THE Documentation SHALL guide users to share error context with AI
5. WHEN support docs are updated, THE Documentation SHALL maintain technical accuracy for AI agent reference

### Requirement 7: Chinese Documentation Synchronization

**User Story:** As a Chinese-speaking user, I want Chinese documentation that conveys the same AI autonomy message, so that I have the same understanding as English-speaking users.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN English documentation is updated, THE System SHALL identify corresponding Chinese files requiring updates
2. WHEN Chinese documentation is updated, THE Documentation SHALL convey equivalent AI autonomy messaging in culturally appropriate language
3. WHEN Chinese documentation is updated, THE Documentation SHALL maintain consistency with English version structure and content
4. WHEN Chinese translations are created, THE Documentation SHALL use natural Chinese expressions for AI autonomy concepts
5. WHEN Chinese documentation is complete, THE Documentation SHALL have equivalent coverage of all English content

### Requirement 8: Documentation Validation

**User Story:** As a documentation maintainer, I want to validate that all documentation consistently reflects AI autonomy, so that users receive a coherent message.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN documentation updates are complete, THE System SHALL verify no files contain "run `kse create-spec`" instructions
2. WHEN documentation is validated, THE System SHALL verify all "you create/run/execute" patterns are replaced with AI-centric language
3. WHEN documentation is validated, THE System SHALL verify Tool_Guides maintain technical reference quality
4. WHEN documentation is validated, THE System SHALL verify English and Chinese versions are aligned
5. WHEN validation is complete, THE System SHALL generate a compliance report showing all files meet AI autonomy standards

### Requirement 9: Documentation Style Guide

**User Story:** As a future documentation contributor, I want a style guide that defines AI autonomy documentation standards, so that new documentation maintains consistency.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. THE Documentation_System SHALL create a style guide defining AI autonomy documentation principles
2. WHEN the style guide is created, THE Documentation SHALL include before/after examples for common patterns
3. WHEN the style guide is created, THE Documentation SHALL define prohibited language patterns (e.g., "you run", "manually create")
4. WHEN the style guide is created, THE Documentation SHALL define preferred language patterns (e.g., "AI creates for you", "tell AI to")
5. WHEN the style guide is created, THE Documentation SHALL provide guidelines for balancing AI autonomy messaging with technical reference needs

### Requirement 10: Backward Compatibility Preservation

**User Story:** As a user with existing kse installations, I want documentation updates to not break my understanding of core concepts, so that I can continue using kse effectively.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN documentation is updated, THE Documentation SHALL preserve all technical command reference information
2. WHEN documentation is updated, THE Documentation SHALL maintain all existing command syntax documentation
3. WHEN documentation is updated, THE Documentation SHALL preserve all configuration and setup instructions
4. WHEN documentation is updated, THE Documentation SHALL maintain all troubleshooting technical details
5. WHEN documentation is updated, THE Documentation SHALL ensure AI agents can still find all necessary technical information
