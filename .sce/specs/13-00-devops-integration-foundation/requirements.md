# Requirements Document: DevOps Integration Foundation

## Introduction

This specification defines the foundation for extending kse from a development tool to a DevOps integration platform. The goal is to enable AI to manage operations across multiple computers, reducing operational overhead by building operations knowledge into the development process. This creates a research and operations integrated service engine where AI can progressively take over operational responsibilities.

The system recognizes that operations are project-specific and version-specific, not generic. Each project has unique operational characteristics that must be captured, managed, and executed according to appropriate security levels.

## Glossary

- **kse**: Kiro Spec Engine, the CLI tool for Spec-driven development
- **Operations_Spec**: A structured set of documents defining how to deploy, monitor, and maintain a specific project version
- **Takeover_Level**: The degree of AI autonomy in executing operations (L1-L5: observation → suggestion → semi-auto → auto → fully autonomous)
- **System_Type**: Classification of systems (kse-developed vs existing systems)
- **Security_Environment**: Deployment environment classification (development, test, pre-production, production)
- **Change_Level**: Classification of change impact (L1: code → L2: config → L3: API → L4: data structure → L5: architecture)
- **Operations_Knowledge**: Project-specific operational procedures, monitoring rules, and troubleshooting guides
- **Version_Context**: The specific project version for which operations knowledge applies
- **AI_Permission_Model**: Dynamic permission system that controls what operations AI can execute autonomously
- **User_Feedback**: External input from end users or customers about system behavior, issues, or feature requests
- **Feedback_Channel**: Method by which user feedback enters the system (support tickets, monitoring alerts, user reports, etc.)

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Operations Spec Structure

**User Story:** As a developer using kse, I want operations knowledge to be captured alongside development specs, so that operational procedures are built-in from the start and versioned with the code.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. ✅ WHEN a kse project is created, THE System SHALL support an operations spec directory structure at `.sce/specs/{project-name}/operations/`
2. ✅ THE Operations_Spec SHALL include these standard documents: deployment.md, monitoring.md, operations.md, troubleshooting.md, rollback.md, change-impact.md, migration-plan.md, feedback-response.md, tools.yaml
3. ✅ WHEN an operations spec is created, THE System SHALL validate that all required documents exist
4. ✅ THE System SHALL version operations specs alongside code versions
5. ⚠️ WHERE cross-project common operations exist, THE System SHALL support shared operations knowledge (user to confirm: centralized library vs per-project duplication?)

### Requirement 2: System Takeover Strategy

**User Story:** As a DevOps engineer, I want AI to progressively take over operational tasks based on confidence and risk levels, so that I can reduce manual work while maintaining control over critical operations.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. ✅ THE System SHALL support five takeover levels:
   - L1 (Observation): AI observes and logs operations only
   - L2 (Suggestion): AI suggests operations but requires human execution
   - L3 (Semi-Auto): AI executes non-critical operations, suggests critical ones
   - L4 (Auto): AI executes most operations, logs critical ones for review
   - L5 (Fully Autonomous): AI executes all operations autonomously

2. ✅ WHEN a new kse-developed project is deployed, THE System SHALL default to L3 (Semi-Auto) takeover level
3. ⚠️ WHEN an existing system is adopted, THE System SHALL default to L1 (Observation) takeover level (user to confirm: should this be configurable per system type?)
4. ✅ WHEN a takeover level is changed, THE System SHALL log the change with timestamp, user, and reason
5. 🤔 THE System SHALL provide an upgrade path from lower to higher takeover levels (user to confirm: automatic progression based on success metrics, or manual only?)
6. ✅ WHEN AI operates at any level, THE System SHALL log all operations with full context for audit
