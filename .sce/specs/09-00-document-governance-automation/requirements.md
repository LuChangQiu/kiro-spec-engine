# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This specification defines an automated document governance system for the kiro-spec-engine project. Building on the document lifecycle management rules established in Spec 08, this system provides automated detection, validation, and enforcement of document management policies. The goal is to ensure that any project adopting the Spec-driven development approach can maintain clean, well-organized documentation regardless of its initial state.

## Glossary

- **Document_Governance_System**: The automated toolset that enforces document lifecycle management rules
- **Diagnostic_Engine**: Component that scans and analyzes project documentation structure
- **Cleanup_Tool**: Component that removes or relocates non-compliant documents
- **Validation_Engine**: Component that verifies document structure against defined rules
- **Archive_Tool**: Component that organizes Spec artifacts into proper subdirectories
- **Violation**: Any document or structure that does not comply with document lifecycle rules
- **Dry_Run_Mode**: Execution mode that previews changes without applying them
- **Interactive_Mode**: Execution mode that requests user confirmation for each action
- **Root_Directory**: The project's top-level directory
- **Spec_Directory**: A directory under `.sce/specs/{spec-name}/`
- **Permanent_Document**: Documentation intended to persist indefinitely (README, CHANGELOG, etc.)
- **Temporary_Document**: Documentation created for a specific session or task, to be deleted after use
- **Artifact_Document**: Output files from Spec execution (reports, scripts, test results)

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Document Detection and Diagnosis

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to automatically detect document violations in my project, so that I can understand what needs to be fixed without manual inspection.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user runs `kse doctor --docs`, THE Diagnostic_Engine SHALL scan the Root_Directory for document violations
2. WHEN scanning the Root_Directory, THE Diagnostic_Engine SHALL identify any .md files beyond the allowed four (README.md, README.zh.md, CHANGELOG.md, CONTRIBUTING.md)
3. WHEN scanning Spec_Directory structures, THE Diagnostic_Engine SHALL verify each Spec contains the required files (requirements.md, design.md, tasks.md)
4. WHEN scanning Spec_Directory structures, THE Diagnostic_Engine SHALL identify temporary documents that should have been deleted
5. WHEN scanning Spec_Directory structures, THE Diagnostic_Engine SHALL identify artifact files not properly organized into subdirectories
6. WHEN scanning completes, THE Diagnostic_Engine SHALL generate a detailed report listing all violations with their locations and types
7. WHEN no violations are found, THE Diagnostic_Engine SHALL report that the project is compliant
8. WHEN violations are found, THE Diagnostic_Engine SHALL provide actionable recommendations for each violation

### Requirement 2: Automated Cleanup

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to automatically clean up document violations, so that I can quickly bring my project into compliance without manual file operations.

#### Acceptance Criteria

8. WHEN cleanup is cancelled by the user, THE Cleanup_Tool SHALL stop immediately and report what was completed

### Requirement 3: Structure Validation

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to validate my project's document structure against the defined rules, so that I can ensure compliance before committing changes.

6. WHEN validation completes, THE Validation_Engine SHALL output a pass/fail result with detailed findings
7. WHEN validation fails, THE Validation_Engine SHALL provide specific recommendations for fixing each issue
8. WHEN the user runs `kse validate --all`, THE Validation_Engine SHALL validate all Spec directories in the project

4. WHEN the Archive_Tool identifies a test file, THE Archive_Tool SHALL move it to the tests/ subdirectory
5. WHEN the Archive_Tool identifies a result file, THE Archive_Tool SHALL move it to the results/ subdirectory
6. WHEN the Archive_Tool identifies a documentation file (not requirements/design/tasks), THE Archive_Tool SHALL move it to the docs/ subdirectory
7. WHEN a target subdirectory does not exist, THE Archive_Tool SHALL create it before moving files
8. WHEN the user runs `kse archive --dry-run`, THE Archive_Tool SHALL display what would be moved without actually moving files
9. WHEN archiving completes, THE Archive_Tool SHALL generate a report showing what was organized

### Requirement 5: Git Hooks Integration

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to prevent committing document violations, so that my repository maintains compliance automatically.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user runs `kse hooks install`, THE Document_Governance_System SHALL install a pre-commit Git hook
2. WHEN a commit is attempted, THE pre-commit hook SHALL run document validation
3. WHEN validation fails during commit, THE pre-commit hook SHALL block the commit and display violations
