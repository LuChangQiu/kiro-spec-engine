## 💡 Core Value

### 1. Depth of Thought

**Interdisciplinary Integration**:
- Eastern Philosophy: Wang Yangming's Neo-Confucianism (Unity of knowledge and action, Nothing outside the mind)
- Buddhist Philosophy: Yogacara (Alaya-consciousness, Dependent origination and cessation)
- Western Philosophy: Wittgenstein (Language is the world)
- AI Technology: Agents, MCP, Session management
- Software Engineering: Spec-driven development, Document governance

**Original Insights**:
- "Logic is the rope of thought"
- "Cycles themselves are the rope of logic"
- "Bias is the norm, and also a kind of vitality"
- "Using spec-driven external form to guard inner non-being"

### 2. Practical Value

**Real Experience Support**:
- 2000+ hours of AI programming practice
- Evolution from "passive feeding" to "proactive exploration"
- Balance of three thinking styles (systematic, divergent, evaluative)

**Implementable Methodology**:
- kiro-spec-engine project implementation
- Precisely solving session context consumption
- Document-driven + automated governance
- Practical path for principle-driven Agents

### 3. Unique Value

This article fills an important gap: **There are very few articles that combine Eastern philosophy with AI engineering practice so deeply**.

---

## 🎨 Article Highlights

### Most Brilliant Parts

#### 1. Philosophical Foundations (Round 4)
```
"Logic is the rope of thought"
"Language is the world" (Wittgenstein)
"Nothing exists outside the mind" (Wang Yangming)
```
These three statements form the cornerstone of the entire theoretical framework, connecting abstract philosophy with concrete practice.

#### 2. Cyclical Interpretation of Session Limitations (Round 5)
Elevating technical limitations to a philosophical level, understanding session cycles through "dependent origination and cessation" - this perspective is very unique and profound.

#### 3. Dialectical View of Bias (Round 6)
```
"Bias is the norm, the cycle's current manifestation"
"Bias is also a kind of vitality"
```
Breaking the binary opposition in traditional AI ethics discussions, providing a more dialectical perspective.

#### 4. kiro-spec-engine Implementation
Theory is not a castle in the air but has concrete engineering implementation, making the entire article more convincing.
