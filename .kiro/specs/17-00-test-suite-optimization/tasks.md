## Notes

- Tasks marked with `*` are optional and can be skipped for faster MVP
- Each task references specific requirements for traceability
- Checkpoints ensure incremental validation
- Property tests validate universal correctness properties

- The implementation follows a bottom-up approach: build components first, then integrate
- All analysis tools are implemented as standalone scripts in the spec directory
