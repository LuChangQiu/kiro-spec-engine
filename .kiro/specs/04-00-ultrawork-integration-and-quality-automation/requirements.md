# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This specification defines the requirements for integrating Ultrawork quality automation into the kiro-spec-engine (kse) project. The system shall enhance the Ultrawork tool to actually modify documents (not just identify improvements) and integrate quality checks into the Spec creation workflow to ensure all generated Specs meet professional-grade standards (9.0/10 quality score).

## Glossary

- **Ultrawork_Tool**: The Python-based quality enhancement tool (`ultrawork_enhancer.py`) that evaluates and improves Spec documents
- **Spec_Creation_Workflow**: The requirements-first-workflow subagent that generates Requirements → Design → Tasks documents
- **Quality_Score**: A numerical rating (0-10) that measures document quality based on completeness, clarity, and adherence to standards
- **Quality_Gate**: A checkpoint that requires documents to meet minimum quality thresholds before proceeding
- **EARS_Pattern**: Easy Approach to Requirements Syntax - standardized requirement format (WHEN/WHILE/IF/WHERE/THE system SHALL)
- **Requirements_Document**: The requirements.md file containing user stories and acceptance criteria
- **Design_Document**: The design.md file containing architecture, components, and correctness properties
- **Tasks_Document**: The tasks.md file containing implementation tasks
- **Improvement_Cycle**: The process of evaluating → identifying improvements → applying changes → re-evaluating
- **Document_Modification**: The actual editing of Spec document content to add missing sections, improve formatting, or enhance clarity
