# Implementation Plan: Scene Runtime CLI Integration

## Tasks

- [x] 1 Add scene command module
  - Implemented `lib/commands/scene.js` with option normalization, validation, context construction, and runtime invocation.

- [x] 2 Register scene command in CLI bootstrap
  - Registered `registerSceneCommands(program)` in `bin/kiro-spec-engine.js`.

- [x] 3 Add unit tests for command behavior
  - Added `tests/unit/commands/scene.test.js`.

- [x] 4 Validate runtime + command behavior
  - Executed: `npx jest tests/unit/commands/scene.test.js tests/unit/scene-runtime/runtime-execution-pilot.test.js`.
