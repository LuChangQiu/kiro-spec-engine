# Requirements Document: Template Creation from Existing Spec

## Introduction

This feature enables users to automatically convert their completed Specs into reusable templates that can be shared with the community. Currently, creating templates from Specs is a manual, error-prone process involving copying files, generalizing content, adding metadata, and submitting to the template repository. This feature automates the entire workflow through a CLI command `kse templates create-from-spec`, reducing the time from hours to minutes and ensuring consistency across all community-contributed templates.

## Glossary

- **Spec**: A feature specification in the `.kiro/specs/` directory containing requirements.md, design.md, and tasks.md files
- **Template**: A generalized, reusable Spec with YAML frontmatter metadata and template variables
- **Template_Variable**: A placeholder in the format `{{VARIABLE_NAME}}` that gets replaced during template application
- **YAML_Frontmatter**: Metadata block at the beginning of template files enclosed in `---` markers
- **Template_Registry**: The template-registry.json file that catalogs all available templates
- **Generalization**: The process of replacing project-specific content with template variables
- **TemplateCreator**: The system component responsible for converting Specs to templates
- **ValidationReport**: A report showing whether the generated template meets all quality standards
- **ExportPackage**: The complete set of files ready for submission to the template repository

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Spec Selection and Validation

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to select a completed Spec to convert into a template, so that I can share my work with the community.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user runs `kse templates create-from-spec`, THE System SHALL prompt for the Spec identifier (number or name)

3. WHEN a Spec is selected, THE System SHALL verify that requirements.md, design.md, and tasks.md files exist
4. IF any required file is missing, THEN THE System SHALL display an error message listing the missing files and terminate
5. WHEN all required files exist, THE System SHALL display a summary of the Spec and ask for confirmation to proceed
6. WHERE a user provides `--spec` flag with identifier, THE System SHALL skip the interactive prompt and use the provided value

### Requirement 2: Content Generalization
