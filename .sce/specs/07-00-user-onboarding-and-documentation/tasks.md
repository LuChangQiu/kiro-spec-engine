# Implementation Plan: User Onboarding and Documentation

## Overview

This plan focuses on restructuring and enhancing kse's documentation system to improve user onboarding. The work is entirely documentation-focused with no code changes to kse itself. We'll create a three-tier documentation structure, tool-specific guides, visual diagrams, and automated validation tests.

The implementation follows a logical progression: restructure core documents first, create tool-specific guides, add visual aids, create examples, implement validation, and finally ensure bilingual coverage.

## Notes

- Tasks marked with `*` are optional validation tests that can be skipped for faster completion
- All documentation uses Markdown format for maximum compatibility
- Mermaid diagrams ensure visual aids render on GitHub and most markdown viewers
- The three-tier structure (README → Core Guides → Tool Guides) enables progressive disclosure
- Bilingual support makes kse accessible to both English and Chinese developers
- Automated validation ensures documentation quality remains high as project evolves
- No code changes to kse itself - this is purely a documentation improvement project
