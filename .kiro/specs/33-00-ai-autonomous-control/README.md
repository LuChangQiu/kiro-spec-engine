# AI Autonomous Control - MVP

## Status: MVP Complete ✅

A working MVP of the autonomous control system has been implemented.

## What's Implemented

### Core Components
- ✅ **ConfigSchema** - Configuration management with 3 modes
- ✅ **StateManager** - Execution state persistence
- ✅ **TaskQueueManager** - Task queue with dependency analysis
- ✅ **ErrorRecoveryManager** - Intelligent error recovery with learning
- ✅ **ProgressTracker** - Real-time progress monitoring
- ✅ **DecisionEngine** - Autonomous technical decisions
- ✅ **CheckpointManager** - Strategic pause points and rollback
- ✅ **AutonomousEngine** - Central orchestrator

### CLI Commands
```bash
kse auto create "feature description"  # Create and run Spec
kse auto run <spec-name>               # Run existing Spec
kse auto status [spec-name]            # Show status
kse auto resume [spec-name]            # Resume paused execution
kse auto stop <spec-name>              # Stop execution
kse auto config                        # Manage configuration
```

### Modes
- **conservative**: More checkpoints, more user approvals
- **balanced**: Moderate checkpoints (default)
- **aggressive**: Minimal checkpoints, maximum autonomy

## Quick Start

```bash
# Create and run a Spec autonomously
kse auto create "user authentication system"

# Run an existing Spec
kse auto run 33-00-ai-autonomous-control --mode balanced

# Check status
kse auto status 33-00-ai-autonomous-control
```

## What's NOT Implemented (Future Work)

- Property-based tests (optional tasks skipped for MVP)
- Unit tests (optional tasks skipped for MVP)
- Integration tests (optional tasks skipped for MVP)
- Learning system persistence
- Advanced Spec generation (currently simplified)
- Safety boundaries enforcement
- Integration with existing features

## Architecture

```
AutonomousEngine
├── TaskQueueManager (task execution)
├── ErrorRecoveryManager (error handling)
├── ProgressTracker (monitoring)
├── DecisionEngine (decisions)
├── CheckpointManager (pause/rollback)
└── StateManager (persistence)
```

## Next Steps

1. Test MVP with real Specs
2. Implement comprehensive test suite
3. Enhance Spec generation with AI
4. Add safety boundaries
5. Integrate with collaboration system
6. Add learning persistence
7. Create detailed documentation

## Notes

This is an MVP implementation focusing on core functionality. The system can:
- Load and execute tasks from tasks.md
- Handle errors with retry logic
- Track progress in real-time
- Create checkpoints
- Persist state for resumption

The actual task execution is simplified in MVP - it marks tasks as complete without real implementation. This provides the infrastructure for full autonomous execution.
